 Q2) Write a Python program to calculate the distance between Cairo and Nairobi City
    Steps and Algorithm
                  1) to load cities dataset
                  2) to read more about geopy- https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#module-geopy.distance
                  3) import pandas to allow array

                  5) load the dataframe with capitals
                  6) rename so that the column names are shorter and comply with PEP-8
                  7) to start with let's filter only 2 capitals using the function isin(). Cairo and Nairobi.
                  8) Out put and calculate distance using distance() function
                  9)
                  
                  
 Q3) Write a Python function to get the city, state and country name of a specified latitude and longitude using Nominatim API and Geopy package.
          Steps and Algorithm:
                      1) Import Nominatim
                      2) set user_agent- is an http request header that is sent with each request.
                      3) Prompt user to input latitudes and longitude and separate them using space
                      4) print the altitude and longitude
                      5) use geolocator() and geocode() function and method to locate the address using the longitude and latitude
                      6)
                      7)
                      8)
                      
                      
 Q4) Write a Python program to search the country name from a given state name using the Nominatim API and GeoPy package
         Steps and Algorithm:
                      1) Import Nominatim
                      2) set user_agent- is an http request header that is sent with each request.
                      3) Prompt user to enter the City he or she wants
                      4) use geolocator() and geocode() function and method to locate the country address using City name
                      5) Use address method to map the name of country
                      
                      
                      
 Q5) Write a Python program to generate an infinite cycle of elements from an iterable. PS: The iterable data type should be a list or a string or a dictionary, etc.
         Steps and Algorithm:
                      1) import iterating tool to help iterating
                      2) Create a function
                      3) call The Function takes only one argument as input it can be like list, String, tuple, etc- cycle()
                      4) Following  loops will run for ever
                      5) Iterate for List
                      6) use for loop to loop and print the result
                      7) You can use the above method for strings and dictionary also.
                   
                  
                      
                      
                      
 Q6) Write a Python program to sort a list of dictionaries using Lambda.
         Steps and Algorithm:
                      1) create a list containing dictionaries
                      2) Print to confirm
                      3) Use the sorted() to sort the dictionary using any key of choice and use Lambada also                      
                      
                      
                      
                      
Q7) Write a Python program to find the maximum and minimum values in a given list of tuples using a lambda function.
        Steps and Algorithm:
                      1) import Nominatim
                      2) set user_agent- is an http request header that is sent with each request.
                      3) prompt user to enter the zipcode of the place
                      4) use geolocator() and geocode() function and method to locate the country address using City name
                      5) Use address method to map the name of country
