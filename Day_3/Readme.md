Q1) Write a NumPy program to get the dates of yesterday, today and tomorrow
steps

  Step 1: Import the numpy library.
  Step 2: find today's date using the datetime64() function.
  Step 3: find yesterday's date by subtracting the output of timedelta64() function of one day from the output of datetime64() function of today.
  Step 4:

Q2)Write a NumPy program to find the number of weekdays in a given month. Allow the user to input the month and year of their choice.
STEPS
  1) Import the numpy library.
  2) ask user to input date and a year in a given format#
  3) prompt user to input month and year for the first to end
  4) use the busday_count() function to count the days and
  5) datetime64() function to accept the input as date
  6)

Q3) Write a NumPy program to create an array with at least 5 user input integers and determine the size of the memory occupied by the array.

STEPS
  1) Import the numpy library.
  2) create an list
  3) ask the size of array needed
  4) ask user to input the element they want to put
  5) add element from user into the list
  6) change the list to a numpy array
  7) check the length of array
  8) get the size of the array
  9) get the memory size of one array element
  10) memory size of numpy array in bytes(all elements)
